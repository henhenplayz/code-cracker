**Buggy Keyboard** <br>
This program simulates a malfunctioning keyboard where pressing the backspace key outputs a "<" character instead of deleting the previous character. The goal is to correct the typed input by processing a string that includes backspaces and outputting the intended text. The program ensures that all backspaces are handled properly, reconstructing the final string without any "<" characters.

**Daily Prize**<br>
This program simulates a daily promotion at a supermarket where customers with the highest and lowest grocery bills are selected for a prize. The person with the highest bill wins a prize equal to the difference between their bill and the lowest bill submitted. The program calculates the total prize payout across multiple days of the promotion, given daily submissions of customer bills.

**Find Sums**<br>
The program finds all distinct subsets of a multiset of integers that sum up to a given target value. It outputs these subsets in lexicographical order and ensures no duplicates. The program handles the case where there are no subsets that match the target sum, printing "NONE" if no valid subsets are found.

**How Many Words**<br>
This program processes large volumes of text to identify and output a list of unique words. The words are considered case-insensitive, and the output is given in alphabetical order. The goal is to extract all unique words from the input and present them in a clean, sorted list.

**Lucky Draw**<br>
This problem simulates a game where participants pick numbers, and the goal is to eliminate adjacent participants if their numbers sum up to an even number. The remaining participants, after all possible eliminations, are the winners. The program determines the minimum number of winners by removing as many adjacent pairs as possible.
